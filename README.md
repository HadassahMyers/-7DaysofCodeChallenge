My Quiz App is a quiz about Type 1 Diabetes
It is aimed at children between the ages of 9-13
Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is a topic close to my heart for personal reasons,
I have always believed technology to be a powerful tool for this particular disease
and I thought it would be an approriate topic for my first ever Android App.

I built the App by creating the psuedocode of each question seperatly,
I then created the logic for capturing each correct answer and storing it 
in a way it can be recalled at the end.
